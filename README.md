Project Euler
==============

Personal repository for Project Euler solutions in various languages.

The sole existence of this repository is for personal motivation to become the greatest
Code master that no one ever was.

# Data Structures & Algorithms
This repository is also a repository housing the useful data structures and algorithms implemented
in multiple languages that I've kept. I can't ever claim to own a tree sort like BFS
much like a Pokemon Master doesn't actually own their Pokemon. For the sake of training
I don't copy-paste code as little as possible.
