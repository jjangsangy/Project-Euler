Personal repository for Project Euler solutions implemented in various languages.

The sole existence of this repository is for personal motivation to become the greatest
Code master that no one ever was.

<small>Yes, I know Pokemon do not actually exist</small>

# Data Structures & Algorithms
This repository is also a repository housing the useful data structures and algorithms implemented
in multiple languages that I've kept. I can't ever claim to own a tree sort like BFS
much like a Pokemon Master doesn't actually own their Pokemon. For the sake of training
I don't copy-paste code as little as possible.

# Become a Master
